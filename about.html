            <p>I've spent ~10 years in the food industry working in flavors regulatory. I've dabbled with code on and off since highschool but finally decided to make a commitment to refining my skills.  I enrolled at Lambda School beginning January 2021.  The projects I share hear showcase my growth as a developer. </p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending time with my fiance and our two dogs.  My hobbies include singing in choir, fountain pens, and gaming (both video and board games).  Along with a good friend, I co-founded the Greater Cincinnati Questing Collective, a moderate sized group of people interested in playing RPG's (like Dungeons and Dragons). In 2019, we successfully ran a 24-hour stream where we raised over $3000 for the Children's Miracle Network.
